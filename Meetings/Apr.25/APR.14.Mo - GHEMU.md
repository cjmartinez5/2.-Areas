-   **Key Decisions:**
    -   Proceed with moving applications to EMU that are already onboarded with Harness CI.
    -   Address the UCP dependency as a priority due to its critical nature for migration.
    -   Topo migration is considered long-term and will be addressed in a separate track.
    - Evergreen will be kept on an allow list as they are heavily Jenkins based.
    - User access to Repos will be migrated over with the Repos to EMU.
    - All on prem users will be migrated to EMU.
    -  Repo migration will have a Dry Run process in order to allow teams to check all dependencies prior to production migration.
    - Any users or applications that rely on personal API keys need to be migrated to using GitHub apps.
-   **Action Items:**
